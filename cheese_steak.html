<h1>Steps</h1>
<h2>For the steak</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Mix the Worcestershire sauce, olive oil, hot sauce, and 5 cloves of chopped garlic in a large glass baking dish. Add the steak and swish around, turning until evenly coated. </li>
    <li>Marinate at room temperature for 15 to 30 minutes, or cover and refrigerate for up to 4 hours, flipping the steak once or twice. </li>
    <li>Preheat an outdoor barbecue or griddle pan to medium to medium-high heat. </li>
    <li>Remove the steak from the marinade and season 1 side with salt and pepper. Place seasoned side of the meat down on the barbecue or the griddle. Cook the steak undisturbed for 5 minutes. Then rotate the meat about 90 degrees (don't turn it over) on the barbecue or griddle to make clear cross marks and cook for another 2 minutes. </li>
    <li>Season the other side of the steak with salt and pepper and flip. Continue to cook until an instant-read thermometer registers 60C for medium, about 8 to 10 minutes. Transfer to a cutting board to rest for 15 minutes. </li>
</ol>

<h2>For the onions</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Meanwhile, heat a large pan over medium-high heat, add the olive oil and when shimmering add the onions. Cook, stirring occasionally; until the onions are brown, about 8 minutes. </li>
    <li>Then stir in the garlic, salt, thyme, and hot sauce, cook until onions are tender, about 4 minutes. Add the broth and scrape up any browned bits from the bottom of the pan. Cook until all the chicken broth is gone, and then season with pepper. Set aside. </li>
</ol>

<h2>For the cheese sauce</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Mash the blue cheese in a bowl with the mayonnaise or sour cream, lemon zest, and pepper to taste. Set aside. </li>
</ol>

<h2>For the roasted tomatoes</h2>
<ol>
   <li>Preheat the oven to 210C/Gas Mark 7.</li>
   <li>Toss the tomatoes in a large bowl with the olive oil, thyme, garlic, salt and pepper. Transfer to a baking tin cut side up and roast until soft and juicy, about 20 minutes. </li>
</ol>

<h2>To assemble the sandwiches</h2>
<ol>
   <li>To assemble the sandwiches:</li>
   <li>Rub the toasted bread with the remaining clove of garlic.</li>
   <li>Thinly slice the meat across the grain and assemble the sandwiches. Spread a few tablespoons of the blue cheese sauce on each sandwich, top with some of the steak, onions, roasted tomatoes and watercress.</li>
   <li>Serve warm or at room temperature.</li>
