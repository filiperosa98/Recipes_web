<h1>Ingredients</h1>
<ul>
    <li>1 shallot</li>
    <li>1 pound meat loaf mix or ground beef</li>
    <li>1/2 cup plain breadcrumbs</li>
    <li>1/3 cup ketchup</li>
    <li>1 large egg, lightly beaten</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
    <li>Salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
    <li>4 slices provolone or Swiss cheese</li>
    <li>1 pound bag frozen cut green beans</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
    <li>4 potato hamburger buns, split</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons mayonnaise</li>
    <li>4 lettuce leaves</li>
</ul>

<h2>Method</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Preheat the grill.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Grate the shallot over a large bowl. Add the meat loaf mix, breadcrumbs, half the ketchup, egg, Worcestershire sauce, 1 teaspoon salt and several grinds of pepper. Use your hands to thoroughly combine the mixture, then divide it into 4 equal balls and shape each into a patty a little less than 1/2 inch thick. Arrange on a baking sheet and grill until the tops of the patties begin to firm up and brown, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip the patties with a metal spatula and continue to broil until cooked through, 2 to 3 minutes more.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Brush each patty with some of the remaining ketchup and top each with a slice of cheese. Continue to broil until the cheese melts, about 30 seconds more.</li>
    <br>
    <li>While the patties broil, put the green beans, butter, 1 tablespoon water, 1/2 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper in a medium microwave-safe bowl. Cover and microwave until hot, 4 to 5 minutes.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Open the buns and spread the cut sides with mayonnaise. Place a lettuce leaf and patty in each. Serve each sandwich with a small bowl of green beans.</li>
