<h1>Ingredients</h1>
<ul>
    <li>Salt</li>
    <li>1 large bunch kale, stemmed and leaves torn (about 1 pound)</li>
    <li>10 ounces whole wheat spaghetti</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons roasted salted pistachios</li>
    <li>1 clove garlic, smashed</li>
    <li>1 cup fresh flat-leaf parsley leaves</li>
    <li>1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons freshly grated Parmesan or vegetarian alternative</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice, plus lemon wedges, for serving</li>
    <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
</ul>

<h2>Method</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Fill a large bowl with ice and water. Add the kale to the boiling water and cook, stirring, until just wilted but still bright green, about 2 minutes. With a slotted spoon, transfer the kale to the ice water (keep the water boiling). When cool, drain well and squeeze out as much water as possible. Coarsely chop the kale.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Add the pasta to the boiling water and cook according to the package directions. Reserve 1/2 cup of the pasta water, and then drain the pasta.</li>
    <br>
    <li>While the pasta cooks, pulse the pistachios and garlic in a food processor until finely chopped. Add the kale and parsley and pulse until very finely chopped. With the machine running, add the oil in a steady stream. Add the Parmesan, lemon juice and 1/2 teaspoon each salt and pepper and pulse to incorporate.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Toss the pasta with the pesto, adding a few spoonfuls of the reserved cooking water if it seems dry. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Serve with lemon wedges on the side. </li>
